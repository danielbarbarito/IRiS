IRiS
---------
Incident Response integration System

What is it?
-----------
IRiS allows users to view and manage incidents consisting of relevant
metadata such as IP address(v4/v6), usernames, MAC addresses,
description, time, etc. IRiS can query various network
technologies(Firewall, IPS, etc.) through a RESTful architecture for
alerts that need to be parsed and associated into incidents. Once these
alerts have been enriched and organized into incidents, they will be
inserted into a MongoDB database to be later queried by the IRT. This
database interaction will allow IRTâ€™s to develop patterns and
relationships between incidents and facilitate the ability for an IRT
to quickly respond to threats.
