IRiS
---------
Incident Response integration System

What is it?
-----------
IRiS allows users to view and manage incidents consisting of relevant
metadata such as IP address(v4/v6), usernames, MAC addresses,
description, time, etc. IRiS can query various network
technologies(Firewall, IPS, etc.) through a RESTful architecture for
alerts that need to be parsed and associated into incidents. Once these
alerts have been enriched and organized into incidents, they will be
inserted into a MongoDB database to be later queried by the IRT. This
database interaction will allow IRT’s to develop patterns and
relationships between incidents and facilitate the ability for an IRT
to quickly respond to threats.
